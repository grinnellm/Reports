In the 1950s and 1960s, the reduction fishery dominated \fishName{} catch;
starting in the 1970s, catch has been predominantly from roe seine and gillnet fisheries.
The reduction fishery is different from current fisheries in several ways.
First, the reduction fishery caught \fishName{} of all ages, whereas current fisheries target spawning (i.e., mature) fish.
Thus, reduction fisheries included age-1 fish which are not typically caught in current fisheries.
Second, the reduction fishery has some uncertainty regarding the quantity and location of catch; in some cases this may affect our ability to allocate catch to a specific SAR.
For the roe gillnet fishery, all \fishName{} catch has been validated by a dockside monitoring program since `r validCatch$RoeGN`;
the catch validation program started in `r validCatch$RoeSN` for the roe seine fishery.
Finally, the reduction fishery operated during the winter months, whereas roe fisheries typically target spawning fish between February and April.

Landed commercial catch of \fishName{} by year and fishery is shown in \autoref{tabCatchCommUseYr} and \autoref{figCatchGear}.
\iftoggle{catchStatArea}{In addition to annual catch variability, catch varies among Statistical Areas (\autoref{figCatchStatArea}).}{\unskip}
Total harvested spawn on kelp (SOK) in \thisYr{} in the \regionName{} \regionType{} SAR is shown in \autoref{tabHarvestSOK}; we also calculate the estimated spawning biomass associated with SOK harvest.

<!-- Currently, catch input to the stock assessment model does not include mortality from the commercial SOK fishery, nor any recreational or FSC fisheries. -->

In \thisYr{}, `r nSampThisYr` \fishName{} biological samples were collected and processed for the \regionName{} \regionType{} SAR (\autoref{tabBioNum}, \autoref{tabBioTypeNum}), and a total of `r numAgedThisYr` \fishName{} were aged in \thisYr{}. 
\iftoggle{numPropWtAge}{Differences between biological data collected from two sampling protocols regarding the number-, proportion-, weight-, and length-at-age for \fishName{} in \thisYr{} in the \regionName{} \regionType{} SAR are shown in \autoref{tabDeltaNumAgeYr}, \autoref{tabDeltaPropAgeYr}, \autoref{tabDeltaWtAgeYr}, and \autoref{tabDeltaLenAgeYr}, respectively.
The nearshore sampling program is a multi-year pilot study (using cast nets), therefore only biological data from the seine samples were used for the purposes of stock assessment.
Summaries of data collected by the nearshore samping program are shown in \autoref{tabNearNum}, \autoref{tabNearProp}, \autoref{tabNearWt}, and \autoref{tabNearLen}.
In addition, \autoref{figLengthAgeSample} and \autoref{figLengthAgeSampleSA} show differences in length-at-age between the two sampling protocols, and differences by Statistical Area, respectively.}{\unskip}
