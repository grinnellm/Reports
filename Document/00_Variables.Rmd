<!-- Some common notes and comments -->
\newcommand{\sampleSize}{Each sample is approximately 100 fish.}
\newcommand{\seineSamples}{Biological summaries only include samples collected using seine nets (commercial and test) due to size-selectivity of other gear types such as gillnet.}
\newcommand{\repSamples}{Only representative biological samples are included, where 'representative' indicates whether the \fishName{} sample in the set accurately reflects the larger \fishName{} school.}
\newcommand{\plusGroup}{The age-`r max(ageRange)` class is a 'plus group' which includes fish ages `r max(ageRange)` and older.}
\newcommand{\spawnIndex}{The 'spawn index' is not scaled by the spawn survey scaling parameter, $q$.}
\newcommand{\trendLine}{The thick black line is a `r smLine` curve, and the shaded area is the `r ciLevel*100`\% confidence interval.}
\newcommand{\qPeriods}{The spawn index has two distinct periods defined by the dominant survey method: surface surveys (`r qYrs$q1`), and dive surveys (`r qYrs$q2`).}
\newcommand{\legendNear}{Legend: 'Nearshore' refers to samples collected using cast nets as part of a pilot study with First Nations.}
\newcommand{\legendGear}{Legend: 'Other' represents the reduction, the food and bait, as well as the special use fishery; 'RoeSN' represents the roe seine fishery; and 'RoeGN' represents the roe gillnet fishery.}
\newcommand{\darkThisYr}{The year \thisYr{} has a darker bar to facilitate interpretation.}
\newcommand{\withPrivacy}[1]{Note: data may be withheld due to privacy concerns (#1).}
\newcommand{\noSOK}{Data from the spawn-on-kelp (SOK) fishery are not included.}
\newcommand{\spawnIndexTechReport}{See the \href{https://github.com/grinnellm/HerringSpawnDocumentation/blob/master/SpawnIndexTechnicalReport.pdf}{draft spawn index techincal report} for calculations to convert SOK harvest to spawning biomass.}
\newcommand{\missingSpawn}[1]{Missing spawn index values (#1) indicate incomplete spawn surveys.}
\newcommand{\spawnTypes}{There are three types of spawn survey observations: observations of spawn taken from the surface usually at low tide, underwater observations of spawn on giant kelp, Macrocystis (\emph{Macrocystis} spp.), and underwater observations of spawn on other types of algae and the substrate, which we refer to as `understory.'}
\newcommand{\pctChange}[1]{Percent change is $\delta_t=\frac{\alpha_t - \alpha_{t-1}}{\alpha_{t-1}}$ where $\alpha_t$ is the #1 in year $t$.}
