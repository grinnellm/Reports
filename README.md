# Pacific Herring data summary reports

We create annual data summary reports for Pacific Herring, summarized by stock assessment region.
These reports contain data used in stock assessments, and other information that is not used in stock assessments.
These reports contain preliminary data, which may differ from the data used and presented in the final Pacific Herring stock assessments.
Figures and tables in these reports are generated in [DataSummaries](https://github.com/grinnellm/DataSummaries).
