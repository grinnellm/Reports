\begin{itemize}

\item The Haida Gwaii minor stock assessment area (A2W)
was open for commercial SOK harvest but there was no effort in 2024.

\item Spawn timing when compared to recent years was approximately
15 days earlier in the minor stock area.

\item Water temperatures as recorded by the test vessel were almost
2 degrees higher than those recorded in recent years in A2W.

\item There were several days of sunshine during the assessment period
and satellite photos proved very helpful in identifying spawns
in Area 2W where vessel coverage is sparse.

\item Herring were sounded and sampled in the Englefield Bay area (A2W)
and for the first time in many years a follow up
surface survey assessment of spawn in the Inskip area was completed.
