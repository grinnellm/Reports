\item The Haida Gwaii major stock assessment area
remained closed to commercial harvest in in 2024.

\item Spawn timing when compared to recent years was approximately
10 days earlier in the major stock area.

\item Water temperatures as recorded by the test vessel were almost
2 degrees higher than those recorded in recent years in the major area.

\item The main herring concentrations were in the
Upper Burnaby and Skincuttle areas
with no major aggregations observed in Juan Perez Sound. 

\item There were only scratches found in Selwyn Inlet and
there was no significant spawning event which seemed unusual.

\item As in recent years, numerous (i.e., more than 25) Humpback Whales
were observed in the major stock area and
a few Gray whales were also observed in the area during the later assessments.

\item All major area spawns were identified and dive assessments completed.
