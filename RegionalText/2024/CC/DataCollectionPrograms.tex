The data collection program in the Central Coast reflected
a number of collaborations between
DFO, the Heiltsuk Nation, and the Herring Industry.
Biological samples were collected by the seine test charter vessel
\boat{Ocean Venture} for 20 days from March \nth{17} to April \nth{7}.
The primary purpose of the test charter vessel was to
collect biological samples from main bodies of herring
in Statistical Areas 06, 07, and 08, identified from soundings.
Heiltsuk and Kitasoo Nations collected nearshore
cast net herring samples again this season.
Herring spawn locations were primarily identified with fixed-wing overflights.
Six spawn flights were conducted this season from
the end of March to mid-April.
Additional spawn reconnaissance for Area 08 was conducted
by the Wuikinuxv Fisheries Program.

Two dive charter vessels operated in the CC:

\begin{itemize}

\item The \boat{Pachena No. 1} surveyed 21 days
from April \nth{4} to April \nth{21}, and

\item The \boat{Ocean Cloud} surveyed 12 days
from April \nth{4} to April \nth{15}.

\end{itemize}
