This herring season spawning behavior was similar to last year,
starting on March \nth{28} and ending on April \nth{11}.
Observations of the younger age-3 class observed in the shallower water column,
with roe build up taking longer than usual.
Food fishers reported that herring roe build up was occurring in the evening,
and that small herring were present throughout.  
The number of whales in the area decreased from previous years.
The sea lion population was similar to previous years and
dispersed to multiple areas,
with observations of 20 or more sea lions in groups
in the heavier spawning locations. 
Deeper spawn was observed in a few places and
clear water spawn (i.e., spawn without milt) was reported as well.
