Biological samples were collected by two seine test vessels:

\begin{itemize}

\item The \boat{Nita Maria} collected samples in Big Bay
for 13 days from March \nth{16} to March \nth{28}, and 

\item The \boat{Viking Spirit} collected samples in Kitkatla
for 13 days from March \nth{15} to March \nth{27}.

\end{itemize}

The primary purpose of the test charter vessels was to
collect biological samples from main bodies of herring
from Big Bay and Kitkatla, identified from soundings.

\begin{itemize}

\item The dive charter vessel \boat{Royal Pride} surveyed spawn
for 20 days from March \nth{26} to April \nth{14}.

\end{itemize}

Herring spawn locations were primarily identified with
fixed-wing overflights and on-grounds observations from test and dive vessels.
Two spawn flights were conducted this season on March \nth{21} and April \nth{4}.
Additional on-grounds spawn observations were provided by
Lax Kw'alaams Band, Metlakatla and Gixaala First Nation.
