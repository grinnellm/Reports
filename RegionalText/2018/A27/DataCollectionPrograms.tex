The ``Seaveyor'' surveyed the area March \nth{12} to March \nth{15}.
Survey effort was concentrated in Section 273, and identification of spawning events relied largely on communication from local residents to the DFO Resource Manager.
The spawn dive survey in Area 27 found 18 transects running from Matthews Island up into Forward Inlet.
The survey team scouted the rest of the area, but found no other spawn.
