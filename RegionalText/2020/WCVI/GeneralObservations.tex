\item As planned, the assessment program included seine and dive vessels.

\item All major observed spawns were surveyed by divers.
Notably, divers surveyed spawn on Bajo Reef during a calm break in the weather.
However, some minor spawns in Clayoquot Sound were missed.

\item First Nations herring survey staff were able to inform local First Nations of opportunities to place boughs in active spawn areas.

\item Many of the other 2020 WCVI herring spawn events were detected during the 13 reconnaissance flights between February \nth{24} to March \nth{29}.
Spawn location information was relayed from First Nations herring charter leaders, reconnaissance flight staff, test vessel and dive vessel skippers to DFO land-based staff during flights to ensure the best coverage and recording of spawn areas.

\item Grey Whales were observed feeding on spawn in all major locations, particularly Hesquiaht Harbour as usual.
Some sea lions were also observed.
