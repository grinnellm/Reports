\begin{itemize}

\item This year had the first commercial SOK fishery since 2014.
This fishery provided useful information on when to start the six day spawn assessment charter.

\item Spawn seemed to start and stop over a longer period of time than in past years.

\item Both Stellar and California Sea Lions were present.
The relative abundance of California Sea Lions seems to have increased in recent years.
