In 2020, biological samples were collected by two seine test vessels:
\begin{itemize}
\item The ``Nita Maria'' collected samples in Big Bay for 18 days from March \nth{15} to April \nst{1}, and
\item The ``Viking Leader'' collected samples in Kitkatla for 18 days from March \nth{16} to April \nnd{2}.
\end{itemize}
The primary purpose of the test charter vessels was to collect biological samples from main bodies of herring from Big Bay and Kitkatla, identified from soundings.
% Both vessels were also used as management platforms: ``Franciscan No.1'' in Kitkatla, and ``Nita Maria'' in Big Bay. 
Herring spawn locations were primarilyidentified using a drones, operated from both the ``Nita Maria'' and the ``Viking Leader''.
%One overflight was conducted in early April.
Due to Covid-19, the dive charter vessel ``Royal Pride'' was repurposed as a surface survey charter, successfully conducting surface surveys for 17-day charter from March \nth{27} to April \nve{12}, surveying spawn throughout the stock area.
All three charter vessels were funded by DFO, through a contract to the Herring Conservation Research Society.
