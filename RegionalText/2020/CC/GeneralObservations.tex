\begin{itemize}

\item The SOK fishery was cancelled, but FSC did proceed.

\item Overall it seemed like a better spawn year than last year.

\item Spawn quality in several areas was very good, and was similar to last year.
For example, divers reported over a dozen layers and spawn at depths beyond where the divers could go.
A diver reported that the Thompson Bay area had the heaviest spawn on macro that he has ever seen.

\item There was spawn in areas that had not spawned much or at all in recent years, such as Stryker Bay, Thompson Bay, and Weeteeum Bay.

\item Some areas did not receive a lot of spawn like they did last year (e.g., Norman Morison Bay).

\item The fish seemed to hold a long time and were not in a hurry to spawn.

\item There was a little more wildlife activity than last season although nothing major.
