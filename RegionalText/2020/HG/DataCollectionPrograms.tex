In 2020, biological samples were collected by the ``Queens Reach'', a seine test charter vessel funded by DFO.
The primary purpose of the test charter vessel was to collect biological samples from main bodies of herring from Haida Gwaii major (priority) and minor stock areas, identified from soundings.
The ``Queens Reach'' operated a 25 day charter from March \nth{9} to April \nth{2}, collecting samples from HG and Area 2 West.
It was necessary to make changes to the dive survey program due to Covid-19. The ``Haida Spirit'' was unable to operate the dive charter however the ``Victoria Rose'' was repurposed from a spawn reconnaissance charter to a surface survey charter and successfully completed a 20 day charter from March \nth{30} to April \nth{18}.
The Atlas completed a 6 day surface survey charter in Area 2 West from April \nth{4} to \nth{9}.

All vessels were funded by DFO, through a contract to the Herring Conservation Research Society.
