\begin{itemize}
\item Majority of spawn surveyed in Kitkatla was on the south end of Porcher extending out into Freeman Pass.
The spawn on the east-side of Gurd Island was smaller than what we have seen in the recent past.
\item Spawning patterns in the Big Bay area were typical for the area (i.e., similar distribution of spawn to previous years).
\item Warmer than usual water temperatures were reported ($\sim8.2\degree$C), contributing to earlier larval hatch-out rates.
This is similar to 2015 observations.
\item Spawn length was below the long term average (since 1980).
Spawn width was above average and consistent with results since 2000 onward.
Spawn layers was below long-term average (since 1980), but very consistent since 2000.
