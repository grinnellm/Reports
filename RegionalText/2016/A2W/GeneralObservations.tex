\begin{itemize}
\item Surface spawn survey was well executed, implementing the snorkel survey methodology developed by HG Resource Managers.
\item Survey efforts were focussed in Port Louis, with a brief visit to Port Chanal.
\item Spawn was surveyed in Port Louis and Port Chanal by surface survey. 
Survey observations indicate very strong and above average spawning abundance in Port Louis.
\item Spawn length, width, and coverage was larger/more extensive than average, and is reflected as an increase in the spawn index data.
