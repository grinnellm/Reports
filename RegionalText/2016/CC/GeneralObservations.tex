\begin{itemize}
\item The addition of a second test charter vessel (one of which commenced in early March) to the Central Coast in 2016 was needed to support data collection in Areas 06, 07, and 08 given the estimated stock biomass has increased since 2012.
\item Herring seemed to arrived later than usual this year in the CC.
\item Stat Area 06: Squid were spawning at the same time as herring around Kitasu Bay.
\item Stat Area 06: Charter skipper reported fungal eggs in Clifford Bay area.
Fewer overall reports of fungal eggs in the CC as compared with 2015.
\item Stat Area 07: Deeper spawn was reported around the boundary of Spiller Channel and Spiller Inlet.
A couple of layers of spawn was observed on bedrock past $30\,\text{m}$.
\item Stat Area 07: Tankeeah and Shingle Rock: dive transects were moved to avoid interaction with SOK lines. 
Moving transects may have an impact on spawn width for this area.
