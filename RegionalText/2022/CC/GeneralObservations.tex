colder water temperatures were reported throughout CC.

management platform logistics.

\item In general, spawn duration was shorter and less consistent
than in previous years.

\item Spawn was less concentrated and began much later in southern areas of the CC.

\item A lack of reliable communication tools between
the management and test platforms made sending and receiving
the most up-to-date information challenging.

all overflights had to be based out of Port Hardy.
