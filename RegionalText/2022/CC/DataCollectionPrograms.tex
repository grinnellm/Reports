In 2022, the data collection program in the Central Coast
reflected a number of collaborations between
DFO, the Heiltsuk Nation, and the Herring Industry.
Biological samples were collected by the seine test charter vessel
\boat{Ocean Venture} for 22 days from March \nth{12} to April \nth{6}.
The primary purpose of the test charter vessel was to
collect biological samples from main bodies of herring in
Statistical Areas 06, 07, and 08, identified from soundings.
Heiltsuk and Kitasoo Nations collected 15 nearshore
cast net herring samples in 2022.
Herring spawn locations were primarily identified with fixed-wing overflights.
Seven spawn flights were conducted this season, in mid-March to mid-April.

Two dive charter vessels operated in the CC:

\begin{itemize}

\item The \boat{Pachena No.1} surveyed 21 days from April \nth{4} to April \nth{24}, and

\item The \boat{Ocean Cloud} surveyed 12 days from April \nth{4} to April \nth{15}.

\end{itemize}

Heiltsuk and Kitasoo Nations collected
15 nearshore cast net herring samples in 2022.
Additional spawn reconnaissance for Area 08
was conducted by the Wuikinuxv Fisheries Program.
