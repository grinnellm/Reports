\begin{itemize}

\item Sounding estimates were much lower than the previous two years,
however sounding in outer Port Louis was hampered by a large swell and
the test vessel skipper felt they might have been a little too early.

\item As in previous years, the majority of spawn was in the Port Louis area
with only trace amounts identified in Port Chanal and other areas to the south.

\item Spawn in the Port Louis area was limited to the entire shore of inner Port Louis
but was not as heavy as 2020.
There was no spawn observed in Otard Bay in 2022.

\item Due to very difficult weather conditions and time constraints
neither the seine test vessel nor the surface survey vessel
were able to assess the Englefield Bay area.

\item No whales were observed in Area 2W in 2022 and
abundance of pinnipeds appeared to be lower than the previous two years.
