In 2022, biological samples were collected by the \boat{Queens Reach},
a seine test charter vessel funded by DFO.
The \boat{Queens Reach} collected biological samples from main bodies of herring
in Haida Gwaii and Area 2 West, identified from soundings.
The \boat{Atlas} completed a 6 day surface survey charter in Area 2 West
from April \nth{5} to \nth{10}.
Both vessels were funded by DFO,
through a contract to the Herring Conservation Research Society.
