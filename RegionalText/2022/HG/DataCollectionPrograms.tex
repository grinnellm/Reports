In 2022, biological samples were collected by the \boat{Queens Reach},
a seine test charter vessel funded by DFO.
The primary purpose of the test charter vessel was to
collect biological samples from main bodies of herring
from Haida Gwaii major (priority) and Area 2W minor stock areas,
identified from soundings.
The \boat{Queens Reach} operated a 25 day charter
from March \nth{9} to April \nth{2},
collecting samples from HG and Area 2 West.
The \boat{Haida Spirit} operated an 18 day dive charter
from April \nth{8} to April \nth{25}.
The \boat{Victoria Rose} operated a spawn reconnaissance charter
for 19 days from April \nth{1} to April \nth{19}
with some surface survey and drop-camera survey work.
All vessels were funded by DFO, through a contract to the Herring Conservation Research Society.
