\begin{itemize}

\item Major stock assessment area sounding estimates
were similar to 2021 but spawn abundance (area and number of layers)
appeared to be considerably lower than the previous two years.

\item Water temperatures (test setting vessel) were similar to the previous two years.

\item Spawn timing was several days earlier than in 2021
and closer to the historical average.

\item Once again, the main spawning concentrations were in Skincuttle Inlet
and around Burnaby Island with only one smaller spawn
occurring in Juan Perez Sound (Sedgwick Bay).

\item Observations suggested fewer whales (Humpback and Gray)
and Sea Lions were present than in 2021.

\item Although less Humpback whales were present than in 2021
they were very focused on the limited number of pre-spawning aggregations,
which limited test setting opportunities.

\item All observed spawns in the major area were assessed by dive and
independent video assessments of 87 duplicate transects
were also completed by the recon vessel to help calibrate the two methodologies.
