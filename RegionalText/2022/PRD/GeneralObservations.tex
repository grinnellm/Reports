Big Bay:

\begin{itemize}

\item Sea surface temperatures were cold at 4$^\circ\text{C}$.

\item With the colder sea surface temperatures the herring were holding and
behaving in a manner that I haven't seen in twenty years.

\item Kelp was more abundant from Tree Bluff south to Duncan Bay. 

\item Overall spawn was more intense over two days and was protracted.
Spawning occurred slowly over the season opposed to the warmer sea temperatures with a short spawn and quick hatch out.

\item Herring were large and healthy.

\item Peak sounding was above average at 15k.

\item Overall length of spawn was shorter, but the layers were thicker.

\end{itemize}
