\begin{itemize}

\item Good coverage of the spawns in terms of cast net sampling by First Nation charters.

\item There were spawns close to communities which allowed better FSC access.
For example, there were spawns inside of Nootka in front of Yuquot,
in Hotsprings Cove, and in front of Tofino.

\item Good communication and observations by First Nation charters
helped with a successful spawn survey this year.

\item Like last year, there was a long spawn in Hesquiat Harbour.

\item There was a later spawn in Barkley Sound that was fairly long.

\item In Area 25 especially, early spawn timing may have limited test boat access.
As well, the fish seemed to be close to the beach and ready to spawn but
the seine boat was unable to catch them.

\item Limited resources truncated the number of reconnaisance flights.

\item Inclement weather interfered with test vessel operations.
For example, strong winds and swell prevented a dive survey
on spawn observed at outer Nootka Island.

\item COVID-19 continues to be a challenge.
