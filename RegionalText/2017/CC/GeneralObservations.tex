\begin{itemize}
\item Similar to last year, herring schools only seemed to migrate up to 35--45\,m in the dark, where they either held there or migrating back to the bottom after a couple hours.
This meant there were fewer opportunities to take seine samples.
\item The soundings were around $10,000\,$t from the beginning of the first seine charter and continuing to the next charter vessel.
Sounding are a measure of relative abundance, and it was unusual that soundings did not change until March 26\textsuperscript{th}.
Soundings increased to $16,000\,$t on March 31\textsuperscript{st}.
\item While spawn timing seemed later than normal, science confirmed that within the last 5 years that could be true.
But looking back 20 years, this spawn timing was average.
\item No fungus on the spawn was observed.
\item Cooler water temperatures (4 to $6\degree$C) were observed.
