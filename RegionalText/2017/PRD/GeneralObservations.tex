\begin{itemize}
\item Herring were in shallow tight to the beach early as observed in the past few years.
Traditionally herring hold along the 110\,m edge before proceeding to the beach to spawn.
\item Compared to average spawn timing, the start of the spawn was early, however the spawn was staggered until mid-April.
Spawn started at Tree bluff (March 16\textsuperscript{th}), and finished in Stumaun Bay (mid-April).
\item Spawning patterns were typical for the area (i.e., spawn distribution was similar to previous years).
\item 2017 Sea surface temperatures ($\sim6\degree$C) were cooler compared to recent years ($\sim8.2\degree$C).
\item Larval hatch out rates were back to normal (2-3 weeks).
