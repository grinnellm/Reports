\begin{itemize}
\item Herring abundance was concentrated along the North Shore of Burnaby Island with reduced abundances in other historical areas (e.g., Selwyn, Skincuttle and Louscoone Inlets).
\item Test samples showed Herring size to be more broadly distributed, which suggests a broad range of age classes.
\item Similar to last year, spawn was concentrated along the outer exposed shore of Burnaby Island.
\item Water temperatures were cooler than 2016.
\item The dive survey was unable to survey approximately 22 transects worth of shoreline (7.7\,km) primarily along the NE shore of Burnaby Island due to unsafe diving conditions.
\item Spawn (2.5\,km) in Louscoone occurred very early at the beginning of March and was also not surveyed.
\item Dive team reports that spawn deposition was thin and patchy compared to previous seasons.
\item Compared to last year, observed soundings were higher, while observed spawn was lower.
