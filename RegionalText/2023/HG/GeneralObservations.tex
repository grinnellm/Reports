\begin{itemize}

\item Major stock assessment area sounding estimates
were approximately 20\% higher than last year.
Initial impressions of spawn abundance by the reconnaisance vessel crew
were that it was similar or possibly a little more than last year.
Note: overall, impressions of the spawn strength
were generally more positive than shown in the survey results.

\item Spawn timing was several days later than recent years and
considerably later than the historical average.

\item Once again, the main herring concentrations were in
Skincuttle Inlet and Burnaby Island
with no major aggregations observed in Juan Perez Sound or Atli Inlet.

\item As in recent years numerous Humpback Whales were observed
in the major stock area but no Gray Whales were observed this year.

\item Presence and feeding behaviour of numerous Humpback Whales
in Skincuttle and Burnaby Strait hampered test setting efforts.

\item Herring were generally deeper and more difficult to seine than most years.

\item Two of the Cumshewa spawns were observed by satellite.
