\item Late February and early March had strong winds
which impacted the effectiveness of the assessment program.

\item Spawn in the Strait of Georgia was observed
along the East coast of Vancouver Island from Kitty Coleman south to Cape Lazo,
on the South-East coast of Denman Island along Gravelly Bay and Boyle Point,
around most of Hornby Island, and

Schooner Cove, Nonooa Rock, and
a late spawn in Kulleet Bay south of Dodd Narrows.

after multiple days of high winds and rough seas,
delayed roughly a week from the previous yearâ€™s spawn.

\item The overall length of spawn (25.1 nautical miles)
observed during the flight program
was below average when compared with recent years.
