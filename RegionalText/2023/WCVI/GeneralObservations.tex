\begin{itemize}

\item Good coverage of the spawns in terms of
cast net sampling by First Nations charters in Areas 23 and 24.

\item Difficulty getting biological samples for the test vessel
and First Nations charters in Area 25 due to
fish being offshore, in close to beach to spawn, and erratic fish movement.

\item There were spawns close to communities that allowed FSC access.
For example, there were spawns in
Hotsprings Cove, near Ahousat, and northern Barkley Sound.

\item Good communication and observations by
First Nations charters helped with a successful spawn survey this year.

\item Good spawn was observed over large geographic areas in Areas 23, 24 and 25.

\item Like last year, there was a large spawn in Hesquiat Harbour
that persisted for several days.
Additionally, there was a large spawn that occurred within Hotsprings Cove
that persisted for several days.

\item There was a later spawn outside of Nootka Sound
south of Escalante Point that covered a large area.
Limited resources, inclement weather, and later spawn timing
prevented dive surveys for spawns at
Nuchatlitz, Escalante Point, and outer Flores Island.
