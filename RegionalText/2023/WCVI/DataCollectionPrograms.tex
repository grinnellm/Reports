Biological samples were collected by the seine charter vessel
\boat{Proud Canadian} for 20 days from February \nth{20} to March \nth{11}.
The primary purpose of the test charter vessel was to
collect biological samples from main bodies of herring
from Statistical Areas 23, 24, and 25.
Nearshore herring samples were collected by the Nuu-chah-nulth staff
as part of a sampling program and on-going collaboration
between WCVI First Nations and DFO.
These nearshore biological samples were collected from
spawning aggregations using cast nets.
WCVI First Nations spawn reconnaissance charters reported
spawn activity in all three areas.
Herring spawn locations were primarily identified with
fixed-wing overflights conducted by DFO Resource Management area staff.
Eight flights were conducted this season in February and March.

One dive charter vessel and a shorebased crew operated in WCVI:

\begin{itemize}

\item The \boat{Pachena No. 1} surveyed 16 days from
March \nth{8} to March \nth{23}, and

\item The shorebased dive surveyed from March \nth{13} to March \nth{23}.

\end{itemize}
