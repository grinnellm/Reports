\begin{itemize}

\item As in most recent years the main stock assessment focus for Area 2W
was around Port Louis but sounding surveys were also completed
in all inlets from Otard Bay to West Skidegate.
Herring schools were sounded in
Port Louis, Port Chanal, Seal Inlet, and Rennell Sound.

\item Due to a limited number of survey days and poor weather
there were no sounding surveys completed in Englefield Bay.

\item In addition to completing the sounding and test setting surveys
for both stock assessment areas,
the Queens Reach crew also completed
the Area 2W spawn surface survey in Port Louis and Otard Bay.

\item Spawn was surface surveyed in both
Otard Bay and Inner Port Louis this year.

\item No spawn was observed in Port Chanal.

\item Approximately 5 Humpback Whales and 40 Sea Lions
were observed in Port Louis and Otard Bay, and a
small numbers of Sea Lions (less than 5) were also noted in
Port Chanal, Rennell Sound, and Kano Inlet.
