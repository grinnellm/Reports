Biological samples were collected by two seine test vessels:

\begin{itemize}

\item The \boat{Nita Maria} collected samples in Big Bay
for 15 days from March \nth{15} to March \nth{29}, and

\item The \boat{Viking Spirit} collected samples in Kitkatla
for 13 days from March \nth{17} to March \nth{29}.

\end{itemize}

The primary purpose of the test charter vessels was to
collect biological samples from main bodies of herring
from Big Bay and Kitkatla, identified from soundings.

\begin{itemize}

\item The dive charter vessel \boat{Royal Pride} surveyed spawn
for 20 days from April \nth{1} to April \nth{20}.

\end{itemize}

Herring spawn locations were primarily identified with
fixed-wing overflights and drone operations.
One spawn flight was conducted this season on March \nth{30}.
Additional on-grounds spawn observations were provided by
Lax Kw'alaams Band and Metlakatla First Nation.
