In 2021, biological samples were collected by two seine test vessels:
\begin{itemize}
\item The ``Nita Maria'' collected samples in Big Bay for 13 days from March \nth{15} to March \nth{27}, and
\item The ``Viking Leader'' collected samples in Kitkatla for 13 days from March \nth{16} to March \nth{28}.
\end{itemize}
The primary purpose of the test charter vessels was to collect biological samples
from main bodies of herring from Big Bay and Kitkatla, identified from soundings.
The dive charter vessel ``Royal Pride'' surveyed spawn for 20 days from April \nth{7} to April \nth{26}.
All three charter vessels were funded by DFO, through a contract to the Herring Conservation Research Society.
