\begin{itemize}
\item Herring behaviour was different than in previous seasons.
For example, spawn was observed in different areas and
there appeared to be less spawn in Spiller Channel.
However, the dive survey indicated only slightly less than observed.
\item Compared to previous years, the weather and water temperature was colder.
\item Continued COVID-19 precautions meant that CC Resource Management staff
were unable to be on the grounds for assessment activities.
\item Reliable communication methods remain a challenge in the Central Coast.
With satellite phone inconsistencies and the inability to use the DFO radio network,
there were limited communications with herring test vessels.
\item Priorities for 2022 are to establish reliable communication methods,
as well as re-establish DFO Resource Management presence on the management platform, 
and Heiltsuk/DFO presence on spawn flights.
