\begin{itemize}
\item Herring behaviour different than previous seasons;
spawn in different areas and apparent lower amount of spawn in Spiller Channel.
However, the dive survey indicated only slightly less than observed.
\item Cold weather, colder surface water temperatures noted.
\item Continued COVID-19 precautions meant that CC Resource Management staff
were not able to be on the grounds during the assessment activities.
\item Reliable communication methods remain a challenge in the Central Coast.
With satellite phone inconsistencies and the inability to use the DFO radio network,
there were limited communications with herring test vessels.
\item Priorities for the 2022 season will be to establish reliable communication methods,
as well as re-establish DFO Resource Management presence on the management platform, 
and Heiltsuk/DFO presence on spawn flights.
