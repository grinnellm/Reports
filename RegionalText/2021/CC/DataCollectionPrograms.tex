The data collection program in the Central Coast reflected a number of
collaborations between DFO, the Heiltsuk Nation, and the Herring Industry.
Biological samples were collected by the seine test charter vessel ``Ocean Venture''
for 22 days from March \nth{16} to April \nth{6}.
The primary purpose of the test charter vessel was to collect biological samples
from main bodies of herring in Statistical Areas 06, 07, and 08, identified from soundings.
Heiltsuk or Kitasoo collected 12 nearshore cast net herring samples in 2021.
Herring spawn locations were primarily identified with fixed-wing overflights.
Eight spawn flights were conducted this season, in late March and early April.
Two dive charter vessels operated in the CC:
\begin{itemize}
\item The ``Pachena No.1'' surveyed 21 days from April \nth{6} to April \nth{26}, and
\item The ``Ocean Cloud'' surveyed 12 days from April \nth{3} to April \nth{14}.
\end{itemize}
Five gillnet sounding vessels were operated by the Heiltsuk Nation this season;
most effort was focused in Statistical Area 07, as well as
effort in Statistical Area 08 to assist in locating fish
for spawn-on-kelp (SOK) operations.
