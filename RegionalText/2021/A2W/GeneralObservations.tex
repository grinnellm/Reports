\begin{itemize}
\item Despite very poor weather conditions in Area 2W
during both the test seine charter and spawn surface survey,
the primary stock assessment goals were achieved.
\item Despite observations of herring aggregations throughout Port Louis
all of the observed spawning seemed to be limited to Otard Bay.
This was thought to be due to prevailing strong westerly winds and
a resulting large swell into much of Port Louis.
The spawn in Otard Bay was very heavy and observations suggested
that all of the herring in the area had spawned there.
\item No other spawns were observed in Area 2W other than
amounts of trace spawn at the head of Kano Inlet and a small spot spawn in Dawson Inlet.
\item There was a large abundance of both Stellars and California Sea Lions
as well as several Humpback whales in the Port Louis area in 2021.
