In 2021, biological samples were collected by the ``Queens Reach'',
a seine test charter vessel funded by DFO.
The ``Queens Reach'' collected biological samples from main bodies of herring,
identified from soundings.
The ``Atlas'' completed an 8 day surface survey charter in Area 2 West from April \nth{5} to \nth{12}.
Both vessels were funded by DFO, through a contract to the Herring Conservation Research Society.
