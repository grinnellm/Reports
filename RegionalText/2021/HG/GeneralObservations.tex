\begin{itemize}
\item Because of continuing COVID-19 constraints,
the dive survey was replaced with a surface survey, and
the seine charter was extended by three days to enhance coverage.
\item The spawn reconnaissance charter was completed by the Haida Fisheries Program.
\item All major observed spawns were surveyed by MV Victoria Rose
using a towed video camera along transects to determine spawn extent and intensity.
These towed video camera transects were effective for spawn assessments, and
may prove useful to supplement future dive surveys.
\item The largest concentrations of spawning occurred around Burnaby Island
as well as the southern and western shores of Skincuttle Inlet and
there were no spawns observed in Juan Perez Sound or Louscoone Inlet.
\item Although the linear extent of spawn was greater than recent years
it appeared to be lighter and less extensive than 2020.
\item As in previous years, the seine test encountered Humpback Whales feeding on herring.
There appears to have been an increase in the number of Grey Whales
feeding on herring spawn over the past five years.
