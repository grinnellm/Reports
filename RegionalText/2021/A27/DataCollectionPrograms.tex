The "Seaveyor" surveyed the area March \nth{14} to March \nth{16}.
Survey effort was concentrated in Section 273, and
identification of spawning events relied largely on communication
from local residents to the DFO Resource Manager.
The spawn dive survey in Statistical Area 27 found spawn
running along the east shore of Forward Inlet.
The survey team scouted the rest of the area, but found no other spawn.
