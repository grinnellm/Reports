\begin{itemize}
\item The fish seemed to continue to spawn later than usual.
\item The surface charter left on April \nth{1}, which is later than past years, but still missed the spawn in Port Louis.
\item A boat from Haida Gwaii found an active spawn in Port Louis on April \nth{10}, after the ``Atlas'' had left the area.
This spawn most likely happened between April \nth{9} and \nth{12}, but it was not surveyed so it is unclear how much spawn occurred.
\item The charter was extended by one day to survey 4.3 km of spawn in Inskip Inlet.
\item Coverage of spawning areas was good despite the unfavourable weather.
