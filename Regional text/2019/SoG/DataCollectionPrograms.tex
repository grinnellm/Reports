Biological samples were collected by the seine charter vessel ``Denman Isle'' for 27 days from February \nth{20} to March \nth{18}.
Four additional Industry test vessels collected biological samples between February \nth{27} to March \nth{20}.
The primary purpose of the test charter vessel was to collect biological samples from main bodies of herring in Statistical Areas 14 and 17, identiﬁed from soundings.

Herring spawn locations were primarily identiﬁed with ﬁxed-wing overﬂights conducted by DFO Resource Management Area staff.
Twenty-two ﬂights were conducted this season, between February and April.
Two dive charter vessels operated in the SoG:
\begin{itemize}
\item The ``Viking Spirit'' surveyed 21 days from March \nth{21} to April \nth{13}, and
\item The ``Ocean Cloud'' surveyed 6 days from March \nth{20} to March \nth{25}.
\end{itemize}
Both dive vessels and the seine charter vessel ``Denman Isle'' were funded by DFO, through a contract to the Herring Conservation Research Society (HCRS).
Additional sampling and sounding efforts conducted through the Industry Test Program were funded by the Herring Industry.
