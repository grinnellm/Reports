The ``Queens Reach'' operated a 25-day charter from March 10\textsuperscript{th} to April 3\textsuperscript{rd}, collecting samples from HG and Area 2W. 
The spawn reconnaissance vessel, Victoria Rose, operated a 19-day charter from March 31\textsuperscript{th} to April 18\textsuperscript{th}, and the dive charter vessel, Haida Spirit operated a 20-day charter from April 3\textsuperscript{rd} to April 22\textsuperscript{nd}.
