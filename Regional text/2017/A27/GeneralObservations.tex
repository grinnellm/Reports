\begin{itemize}
\item The WCVI spawn flight does not cover Area 27.
\item Dive team deployment has been dependent on observations from local residents for the last few years, because the SOK licence holders have elected not to operate.
\item When no spawn reports had been received by late in the season, DFO Resource Management initiated a vessel-based reconnaissance patrol on April 6th; the patrol witnessed one small active spawn, and found another very small older spawn.
\item In the last few years the spawn in Area 27 was reported in early- to mid-March, so it's possible that an earlier spawn was undetected in 2017.
