\item ``Seaveyor'' surveyed the area April 17\textsuperscript{th} to April 19\textsuperscript{st}.
\item Survey effort is concentrated in Section 273 and identification of spawning events relies largely on communication from local residents to the DFO Resource Manager.
\item Spawn dive survey in Area 27 found only 2 transects with spawn.
The survey team scouted the rest of the area, but found no other spawn.
