In 2017, biological samples were collected by the ``Queens Reach'', a seine test charter vessel funded by the DFO.
The ``Queens Reach'' operated a 6-day charter from March 18\textsuperscript{th} to March 24\textsuperscript{th}, collecting biological samples from main bodies of herring, identified from soundings. 
 
The ``Atlas'' operated a 6-day snorkel surface survey in Port Louis, Area 2W, fromApril 1\textsuperscript{th} to April 6\textsuperscript{rd}.
Herring had not started spawning when they arrived and were unable to conduct a survey.
Both vessels were funded by DFO, through a contract to the HCRS.
